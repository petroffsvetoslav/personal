Add hostnames/ips in hosts.ini filed with the established template. Make sure that your ssh key is added to the root user on the remote machines and you can login successfuly using it.
Setup ssh forwarding (e.g- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" + ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa) Check if forwarding is working (ssh-add -l). Eddit the .yml file in order to specify then "/keys" dir path and place the colleague's .pub ssh key in the /keys directory(firstname.lastname.pub). Test if the hosts are visible (ansible -i hosts.ini -m ping hosts) This should return a success message and then you can proceed with running the actual playbook - (sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini deploy-keys.yml) This will attach the .pub ssh-key from /keys directory to that root user. Can be used either for single user key deployment or multiple keys deployment.
