Add hostnames/ips in hosts.ini filed with the established template. Make sure that your ssh key is added to the root user on the remote machines and you can login successfuly using it.
Setup ssh forwarding (e.g- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" + ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa) Check if forwarding is working (ssh-add -l). Eddit the .yml file and specify the user/password to be created and place the colleague's .pub ssh key in the /keys directory(firstname.lastname.pub). Test if the hosts are visible (ansible -i hosts.ini -m ping hosts) This should return a success message and then you can proceed with running the actual playbook - (sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini deploy-keys.yml) This will create a new sudo user with the specified complex password in the file and attach the .pub ssh-key from /keys directory to that user. Can be used either for single user creation/key deployment or a single user(team)/multiple keys.
