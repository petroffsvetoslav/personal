1. Add the desired hosts to the .ini inventory file and make sure to include their root credentials
2. Check the .yml file for what software to install (additional software can be added but make sure to keep the syntax?) 
3. the .cfg file is the ansible configuration file that current disables the known_hosts check

Execute the playbook with
